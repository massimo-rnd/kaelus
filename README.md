## 🚀 Overview

KAELUS is a cross-platform (Windows & macOS) Desktop application written in C#, that extracts E-Mail-Addresses from any URL you enter.

By automatically scanning the source code of each and every link with the same host domain it is able to find email addresses that are listed on said domain, without having to go through them manually.

**Now with multi-processing!**

## 🎯 Features

- Extract email addresses from websites
- Scans every link on a website
- Works on Windows and macOS
- Show results in GUI
- Decode Cloudflare "encrypted" E-Mail-Addresses
- NEW: Multi-Scanning! Choose a TXT file with URLs and scan them all at the same time!

## 🛠️ Installation

### Download the latest version

To start off, please head to the [releases page](https://github.com/druffko/kaelus/releases) and download a pre-built package for your OS.

*If you don't trust me for some reason, feel free to download the latest released source code and build it your self.*

### Launch the application

Launch the application using double clicking. If the Application won't execute because it's from a "unknown developer", right-click and click "open".

## 💻 Usage

### Getting email addresses
Simply enter the URL you want to scan. You can either enter the "http://" or "https://" or just simply leave it out. FindMail will "fix" the URL.

### Click start
Just click start and the applicaton will search the website for email-addresses. Results will be returned in a scrollable textview.

### Multi-Processing
You are now able to use KAELUS' multi-scanning feature to scan may pages at once!

Just create a txt-file, enter the URLs and select it in KAELUS.
